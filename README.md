# About Me
## My Favorite Things
My dog Theo (a miniature dapple dachshund) is my pride and joy. Two of my other favorite yet less interesting things are taking naps and eating sushi. Having all 3 together is my perfect day. 
## Websites I Recommend
1. YouTube (https://www.youtube.com) -> I think that YouTube is interesting because there are millions of videos of simply everything you could ever imagine. Random funny ones, informational & educational, so many things to watch ad get lost in.
2. Google (https://www.google.com) -> I find Google very interesting because of the way that you are able to easily search up any information on any range of topics and find millions of results. It greatly simplified the search for information and drastically reduced the time spent researching.
